# Cricket_cards_game

This is a react JS project built mainly focusing on styling the web app. Used google fonts and CSS (also ﬂex) for styling the cards. Wrote logic for randomly aligning the card and assigning a player as winner or loser according to the total experience he got. The hover eﬀect and transitions are the main catch of this project.
